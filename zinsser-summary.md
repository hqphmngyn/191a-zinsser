# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by HQ Pham-Nguyen

We use too many words thinking it is required of us. It is not. Zinsser tells us we can write more meaningfully with fewer words. Writing that is convoluted cannot encourage clear thoughts. It confuses us rather than bring us clarity. It confuses our readers. They stop reading because our words are meaningless to them. Writing well is hard. Zinsser knows that. We have to make a conscious effort to do better. We must stop inflating our sentences and just say what we want to say. The world is cluttered enough, we don't need to add to it.
